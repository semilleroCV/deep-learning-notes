# Contributing to Deep Learning Notes

We are thrilled to have you contribute to the Deep Learning Notes repository! Whether you're proposing a new notebook, reporting an issue, or enhancing existing content, your input is valuable to ensure the repository remains a valuable resource for the community. Follow these simple steps to make your contribution.

## üìù Before You Begin

- Review existing notebooks in the repository to avoid duplications. If a notebook on your topic already exists, consider [improving it](https://github.com/semilleroCV/deep-learning-notes/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature-report.yml) rather than creating a new one.

## üîÑ Contribution Process

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/semilleroCV/deep-learning-notes.git
cd deep-learning-notes
```
### 2. Create a New Branch üåø
Name your branch according to the type of contribution:

- **Feature**: `feat/topic-name`, e.g., `feat/focal-loss`
- **Enhancement**: `enh/notebook-name`, e.g., `enh/xception-module`
- **Bug Fix**: `fix/notebook-name`, e.g., `fix/mnist`
```sh
git checkout -b type/branch-name
```
### 3. Make Your Changes
- Edit or add your notebook in the appropriate directory under `notebooks/`.
- Ensure your notebook is fully executed and adheres to good coding practices.
- Include a list of libraries and their versions at the top of your notebook ([example](https://github.com/semilleroCV/deep-learning-notes/blob/feat/automation-table/notebooks/_template.ipynb)).
- Name your notebook clearly, must be in lowercase. e.g., `cross-entropy-loss.ipynb`.
- Be simple and precise, if your notebook explains a module of a network, e.g. Xception module, focus only on the Xception module.
### 4. Update the CSV
Add the relevant information about your notebook to the `automation/notebooks-table-data.csv`.
- `display_name` corresponds to the name by which your notebook will appear in the main readme, e.g., `Focal Loss`.
- `notebook_name` where your notebook is located, e.g., `losses/focal-loss.ipynb`
- (Optional) `github_repository_path` link to the source code of the document that you are covering.
- (Optional) `paper_url` URL of the document you are covering, e.g., `https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002`.
### 5. Commit and Push Your Changes
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Add/enh/fix notebook on topic-name"
git push origin type/branch-name
```
### 6. Open a Pull Request
- Go to the repository on GitHub.
- Click "Compare & pull request" next to your branch.

## üêû Reporting Issues
