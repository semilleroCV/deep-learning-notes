# Contributing to Deep Learning Notes

We are thrilled to have you contribute to the Deep Learning Notes repository! We aim to make the contribution process as clear and straightforward as possible. Whether you're proposing a new notebook, reporting an issue, or enhancing existing content, your input is valuable to ensure the repository remains a valuable resource for the community.

## üìù Before You Begin

- Review existing notebooks in the repository to avoid duplications. If a notebook on your topic already exists, consider improving it rather than creating a new one.

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your notebook is fully executed before making a pull request.
2. Include a list of all libraries and their versions used in your notebook at the top.
3. Name your notebook file clearly to reflect the topic, e.g., `cross-entropy-loss.ipynb`.
4. Keep your code simple, precise, and adhere to good coding practices. For example, if your notebook explains Cross Entropy Loss, focus only on Cross Entropy Loss.
5. Place your new notebook in the appropriate directory under `notebooks/`.

## üêû Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please create a [bug report]() in the repository detailing:
- The problem/suggestion in clear terms.
- How it affects the current state of the project.
